    "question": " The defendant decided to kill his neighbor. He set out for the neighbor's house. Before he got there he saw a man who resembled the neighbor. Thinking the man was his neighbor, the defendant shot at the man. The shot missed the man but wounded a child, who was some distance away. The defendant had not seen the child.",

      "optionD": "D. the neighbor and the man."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " The defendant's intention to kill his neighbor does not amount to an attempt to commit murder without a voluntary action; thus, A and D are wrong. The mistake of fact that the man was not his neighbor is crucial in this fact pattern. Because of the doctrine of transferred intent, the defendant's intent to kill his neighbor transfers to the man when the defendant mistakes the man for the neighbor. Thus, the defendant had the intent to kill the man AND took affirmative steps to carry out the crime by shooting at him (mens rea AND actus reus). Therefore, the man was an intended victim. With regard to the child, the defendant can likely be prosecuted for shooting the child but not for attempted murder because the defendant did not have the requisite intent. Unlike with the man, where he intended to shoot him, the defendant shot the child purely because of distance and bad aim. Thus, C is incorrect."

    "question": "  A state statute requires any person licensed to sell prescription drugs to file with the State Board of Health a report listing the types and amounts of such drugs sold if his sales of such drugs exceed $50,000 during a calendar year. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to \"knowingly fail to file\" such a report. The defendant, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 2006 but did not file the report. Charged with the misdemeanor, the defendant testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000.",
    "options": {
      "optionA": "A. guilty, because this is a public welfare offense.",
      "optionB": "B. guilty, because he cannot be excused on the basis of his own failure to keep proper records.",

      "optionD": "D. not guilty, because he was not aware of the value of the drugs he had sold."
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": " The statute itself defines the required mental state by stating that the defendant must \"knowingly\" fail to file the required report. Here, if the jury believes the defendant did not know that he had sold over $50,000 worth of prescription drugs, and thus he did not know that he had to file the report, they should find him not guilty. The mens rea requirement was not met in this case. Answer D is correct."

When one of his children became ill, he did not seek medical attention for the child at a state clinic because he did not want to accept what he regarded as charity.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " The child's death was the result, not of malice aforethought, but of criminal negligence on the part of the father. Failure to seek medical attention for an illness is generally insufficient for the finding of malice aforethought, so the father, in his criminal negligence, has committed involuntary manslaughter."

    "explanation": " The fact pattern tells us that first degree murder is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or homicide in the commission of certain felonies; the answer to this question is discernible relying solely on the first part of the definition. There are two qualifications for a homicide to fall into the category of first degree murder: specific intent and premeditation or deliberation (as required by the statute). The preceding purchase of rat poison, the implied intent to commit murder, and the inherent deliberation necessary for a poisoning clearly show the defendant's premeditation and deliberation."

She is charged with violation of a state statute which provides, \"Any person who appropriates to his own use property owned by the state shall be guilty of a crime and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\" At trial, the camper admits taking the signs but says she believed they had been thrown away.

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": " Although there is no mental state requirement for the offense listed in the statute, one will be presumed by the courts to avoid strict liability offenses. In larceny cases, courts will presume the statute requires an intentional act on the part of the defendant. If the jury finds that the camper honestly believed the signs had been abandoned, the camper will not have the presumed requisite mental state and should be found not guilty. Larceny is generally a specific intent crime and, even if the statute does not specifically list it, it will be presumed to require intent as the mental state. If the camper honestly believed the signs had been abandoned, she did not have the requisite mental state to be found guilty. Answer C is correct."

The husband resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which the woman resided. Late one night, the neighbor and the woman were sitting and drinking on the bed in the woman's bedroom when the husband burst through the door and told the neighbor, \"Get out.\" When the neighbor refused, the husband challenged him to go outside and \"fight it out.\" The neighbor again refused. The husband then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at the neighbor. The neighbor grabbed a lamp, struck the husband on the head, and killed him. The neighbor is charged with murder.",

      "optionC": "C. guilty, because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom prompted the husband's attack.",
      "optionD": "D. guilty, because the neighbor's failure to obey the husband's order to leave the house made him a trespasser."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " The husband, clearly the aggressor, was attacking the neighbor with a deadly weapon, a knife. That, combined with the neighbor's consistent refusal to engage in violence with the husband and that the neighbor used a nearby, available lamp, all are clear indications that the neighbor was acting in self-defense, and thus not guilty of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm as a result of unlawful force. The husband's lunging at the neighbor with a knife was an unlawful use of deadly force, which led the neighbor to reasonably believe that his own use of force was necessary to protect himself. The husband was clearly the initiator of the violence and use of deadly force here."

There must be a nexus between the use or threat of force, and the taking. The defendant's unbuttoning of his victims vest is insufficient to be considered the taking by force, and his later slap did not coincide with the taking, but rather was done to aid in his pretending to be insulted.

Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed.

Relevant statutes define burglary to include \"breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.\" Manslaughter is defined as the \"killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner.\" Criminal recklessness is \"consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct.\" Murder is defined as the \"the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson.\" Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense.

Since there are two ways for the jury to possibly find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury must be instructed that the felony-murder way of charging would be unproven if they believed that the defendant was not guilty, by reason of his intoxication, of the burglary, AND the jury must be instructed that, if they so find, the state must prove the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman. Thus, answer A is correct. The statute regarding intoxication, which controls over common law, indicates it could be a defense to the specific intent crime of burglary, so the jury must be instructed as to the possibility of that defense on the underlying charge of burglary. Without the underlying felony burglary charge, the defendant cannot be found guilty of felony murder."

Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, the defendant turned and struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street. Relevant statutes define burglary to include \"breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.\" Manslaughter is defined as the \"killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner.\" Criminal recklessness is defined as \"consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct.\" Murder is defined as the \"the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson.\" Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense.

    "explanation": " According to the statute, manslaughter is defined as the killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner, and criminal recklessness is defined as \"consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct.\" The mens rea requirement for manslaughter is therefore, that the defendant \"consciously\" disregarded the risks of his conduct. Since intoxication is a defense if it negates an element of the offense, if the defendant was too intoxicated to \"consciously\" disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk, he should be found not guilty of manslaughter as defined by statute."

The lease to these premises gave the landlord a right of entry, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of making repairs.

In fact, that the lease had to contain a provision to allow the landlord such a limited right of entry is an indication that the premises was controlled by the lessee alone. Without authority, the landlord could not waive the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights."

A person can properly claim self-defense if the action taken is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the force the defendant used, a blow to the head, was reasonable in light of the colleague's attacking him with a metal bar. Although he could have escaped, the defendant was not required to do so before using this reasonable force, in part because it wasn't traditionally deadly force. Finally, although the aggressor is not allowed to claim self-defense, in this question the defendant was using words and not a physical attack, so he can properly claim self-defense.

For this argument to work, the statute must, by its nature, involve two necessary parties to the crime, with only one of the parties identified in the statute. If the statute leaves the other one unnamed and unpunished, courts will hold that the legislature did not intend to punish the second necessary party, and he thus cannot be liable as an accessory. When a statute specifically names only one party as being criminally liable when there must be at least 2 or more actors to commit the offense, there is a clear indication that the legislature did not intend the other actor to be punished, and a court will not hold that other actor criminally liable.

Adams cannot bear criminal responsibility for conspiracy to commit larceny, because, if the jury believes him, he never intended to commit larceny."

The state introduced evidence that they agreed to go to a neighbor's house to take stock certificates from a safe in the neighbor's bedroom, that they went to the house, and that they were arrested as they entered the neighbor's bedroom. Adams testified that he thought the stock certificates belonged to Curtis, that the neighbor was improperly keeping them from Curtis, and that he went along to aid in retrieving Curtis's property. Bennett testified that he suspected Adams and Curtis of being thieves and joined up with them in order to catch them.

In this case, it is possible for the jury to find that being struck in the face with an umbrella constituted adequate provocation and that the defendant's response was done in the heat of passion.

The defendant's best defense to a charge of second degree murder is that he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane at the time of the killing. Auditory hallucinations and the belief that he was being unmercifully attacked may show that he was acting under a mental illness which caused a defect in reasoning such that the defendant did not know that his actions were wrong.

Damson also took the property of another, Walter's silverware, and carried it away with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, so he is guilty of larceny. The fact that Damson changed his mind about crime after he had committed them does not negate any of the offenses of either charge, because when Damson broke and entered, and took and carried away the property, he had the intent to permanently deprive the owner. Withdrawal may be a defense to a part of a conspiracy charge, but not to a substantive charge, such as larceny and burglary, where the crime had already been committed. Answer B is incorrect because when Damson committed the larceny, the charge of attempted larceny merged into the larceny charge. Answer C is incorrect because Damson did commit both burglary, for breaking and entering with the intent to commit the larceny, and the larceny itself, by taking the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner. Whereas the attempted larceny and larceny will merge, the burglary and larceny will not merge, because they are separate offenses, with different elements in each one.

In his defense, he testified that at the time he killed her he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He further testified that he had tried many times to dissuade his wife from her plan and had tried to destroy devices that she stored in the basement. She had, he testified, foiled his efforts by, on two occasions, signing papers for his hospitalization, which lasted for a brief period each time. He said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else.

At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. The defendant's actions, which caused the death of his friend, show an extreme reckless disregard for human life, and therefore, he can be properly convicted of murder."

The friend broke into the building and carefully searched it to make sure no one was inside. He failed, however, to see a vagrant asleep in an office closet. He started a fire. The building was destroyed, and the vagrant died from burns a week later. Two days after the fire, the building owner filed an insurance claim in which he stated that he had no information about the cause of the fire.",

    "explanation": " The death of the vagrant was the result of the commission of the offense of arson, and arson is an inherently dangerous felony. It was the action of having the friend set fire to the building, and not the conspiracy or the fraud, which resulted in the vagrant's death. Although common law required the burning to be of a dwelling of another, most states extend arson to structures other than a dwelling, even if the defendant owns it.

In the question, the teller, knowing the man to be violent and jealous, lied to him, and suggested he commit murder. By taking actions that ensured the man would be walking into a heavily guarded bank with a gun, the teller acted with extreme recklessness; this is enough to show implied malice aforethought. Therefore, the teller should be found guilty of murder. An additional facet of the question raises the issue of whether the teller was a \"proximate cause\" of the man's death. The general test is whether the death was foreseeable; a defendant will be held criminally liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions.

The presiding judge asked the defendant whether he understood the nature of the charges, possible defenses, and maximum allowable sentences. The defendant replied that he did, and the judge reviewed all of those matters with him. He then asked the defendant whether he understood that he did not have to plead guilty.

The offense is a strict liability crime and neither the general manager nor the supervising manager needs to have actual knowledge that the children were under the age of 17. Answer A is incorrect because the general manager is criminally responsible for the actions of his agents; there is no violation of due process even if he did not do the act of hiring the children himself. Assigning the responsibility to his agent was a sufficient actus reus for criminal liability. Answer B is incorrect because corporate officers, such as the general manager and the supervising manager, can be held criminally liable for strict liability crimes involving corporations. Although the named employer is the knitting mill, the supervising manager, as the hirer, and the general manager, as his superior, will bear responsibility for those corporate actions in strict liability crimes.

An entry dated the same day as the victim's disappearance read, \"Indescribable excitement. Why did no one ever tell me that killing gave such pleasure to the master?\" The defendant was charged with murder. His attorney has moved to exclude the diary from evidence on the ground that its admission would violate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. Counsel has also argued that the defendant could not give informed consent to the search because more than 48 hours had passed since the making of the entry and hence he could not remember the existence of the incriminating entry at the time he gave his consent.

However, the defendant's lack of intent to kill, his driving off after dropping the friend off, and his turning himself in after the fact, indicate that a sentence of death would be disproportional and unconstitutional."

Early one morning, armed with a pistol, he crouched behind some bushes on a park hillside overlooking a path upon which his neighbor frequently jogged. On this morning, however, the defendant saw his neighbor jogging on another path about a half mile away. Nonetheless, the defendant fired five shots at his neighbor. None of the five shots came anywhere close to the neighbor as he was well out of the range of pistol the defendant was using.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " To be found guilty of attempted murder, a defendant must have the intent to commit murder, and take a substantial step toward the commission of murder. In this question, the defendant had, prior to the shooting, the intent to kill his neighbor, and took the substantial step of firing the weapon at the neighbor. He is guilty of attempted murder. However, if the defendant was aware that it was impossible for his shots to actually reach his neighbor, it cannot be said that the defendant, by shooting at his neighbor, had the intent and took a substantial step to kill the neighbor. If the defendant was unaware of the limited range of his pistol, however, he can be convicted of attempted murder."

The defendant drew a knife and stabbed the sports fan in the stomach. Other people then stepped in and stopped any further fighting. Despite the pleas of the other people, the sports fan refused to go to a hospital or to seek medical treatment. About two hours later, he died as the result of a loss of blood. The defendant was charged with the murder of the sports fan. At trial, medical evidence established that if the sports fan had been taken to a hospital, he would have survived.

    "explanation": " The defendant's motion for acquittal should be denied because there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of murder. The sports fan's refusal to seek medical treatment is an insufficient intervening act to allow the defendant to escape criminal liability for stabbing the sports fan. Whether an intervening act is sufficient to break the chain of causality in a homicide cases rests on the foreseeability of the intervening act. A defendant will be held criminally responsible for the foreseeable consequences of his actions; however, if an unforeseeable act intervenes, a defendant will not be deemed responsible for the death. The defendant stabbed the sports fan in the stomach, and as a result of the injury, the sports fan died. A refusal to get medical treatment by the victim is foreseeable and is insufficient to allow the defendant to escape criminal responsibility for his actions. The motion for judgment of acquittal should be denied."

Between the houses there was a small playground where several children were playing. Nevertheless, the marksman nailed a paper target to a tree and went to a point where the tree was between himself and the playground. He then fired several shots at the target.

    "explanation": " The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender's best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor's age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law.

    "question": "  An employee worked at a day-care center run by the Happy Faced Day Care Corporation. At the center, one of the young children often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father.",

The match burned his finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into a barrel and ignited some paper.

      "optionD": "D. not guilty, because his starting the fire was the result of a reflex action and not a voluntary act."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " Arson is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Although the defendant's actions do not appear to conform to the common law definition of arson, there are two important qualifications to remember. The first is that the element of \"dwelling\" is often disregarded and the definition extends to any structure. Second, under the crime of arson is the subset crime of houseburning. Houseburning is the malicious burning of one's own dwelling if the dwelling is situated so near to other dwellings as to create danger to them. As with the general definition of arson, the term \"dwelling\" is liberally construed to include all structures. In this way, the defendant can be found guilty of arson for burning his own store. Further, arson is not a specific intent crime. Malicious burning does not require proof of intent; malice can be implied in the presence extreme recklessness. The burning need not be intentional, as long as it is foreseeable from the defendant's actions. The defendant in this case, by looking for flammable material with a match, and eventually setting papers in a barrel on fire, was acting with malice. The burning that occurred, although initially done by reflex, was foreseeable from the defendant's actions. The defendant's refusal to put out the fire, combined with his intent that the building be destroyed, makes him guilty of arson."

Several students were injured in the panic that followed as people were trying to get out of the building. The student and the girlfriend are prosecuted for battery and for conspiracy to commit battery.",
    "options": {
      "optionA": "A. guilty of both crimes.",
      "optionB": "B. guilty of battery but not guilty of conspiracy.",
      "optionC": "C. not guilty of battery but guilty of conspiracy.",
      "optionD": "D. not guilty of either crime."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " At common law, battery is a general intent crime and is defined as the unlawful offensive touching of another. The girlfriend and the student as her accessory, by pulling the fire alarm, caused many of the students to be offensively touched to the point of injury. These unlawful touchings were completely foreseeable from the pulling of the fire alarm, and they were the direct result of the student and his girlfriend's intentional act. Because battery is a general intent crime, the student and his girlfriend are guilty of battery. Conspiracy to commit battery, on the other hand, is a specific intent crime and requires an agreement to commit the crime of battery. For a proper conspiracy charge, both parties must reach an agreement and intend that the crime of battery be committed. Because conspiracy is a specific intent crime, there must be proof that both the student and his girlfriend specifically intended for people to be the victims of criminal battery. In this case, although the batteries were a foreseeable consequence of their actions, the student and his girlfriend did not have the specific intent that the batteries occur. Instead, they intended that the student get out of a final exam. The student and his girlfriend should be found not guilty of the offense of conspiracy to commit battery. Therefore answer B is correct."

The defendant is charged with manslaughter."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " Although the defendant intended only to commit serious injury, he should be convicted of murder. At common law, murder is a crime defined as the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. The defendant had the stated intent to commit serious injury, which is sufficient to show the defendant unlawfully killed the victim with malice aforethought. The defendant should be convicted of murder. Answer A is incorrect because a charge of attempt requires the defendant have the intent that the underlying crime be committed, and take a substantial step in the commission of the offense. There is no evidence that the defendant in answer A had the intent to introduce adulterated drugs into interstate commerce, or that he took substantial steps toward the commission of that offense. Answer C is incorrect because arson requires the malicious burning of the real property of another, and, although malice is not a specific intent crime, it means that the burning must be intentional or foreseeable. In answer C, the burning was not intentionally done, and the smoldering wires causing a fire will be found unforeseeable. Answer D is incorrect because manslaughter requires either the reckless or negligent killing of another. In answer D, the actions the defendant took were neither reckless nor negligent and would not be enough to sustain a conviction for manslaughter. Because malice aforethought is specifically defined to include the intent to cause serious bodily injury, the defendant in answer B is most likely to be convicted."

    "explanation": " At common law, false pretenses is obtaining the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. At common law, forgery is the false making or material alteration of a writing where the writing has the apparent ability to defraud and is of apparent legal efficacy with the intent to defraud. The calligrapher did not commit forgery, because the document, by itself, has no legal efficacy or significance, it was merely purporting to be a letter. However, the calligrapher did commit false pretense because she obtained the property and title to property, the $5,000, by fraud and misrepresentation, and she had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Even though she did not specifically promise anything about the letter's authenticity, the calligrapher misrepresented the nature of the letter by saying it was from a collector rather than created by herself; she misrepresented who owned the letter, and how she obtained the letter. Those misrepresentations induced the buyer into giving her the money."

    "explanation": " A state is not constitutionally required to recognize any form of an insanity defense. Although many states do, there is no constitutional requirement that states allow defendants to argue insanity. Answer A is incorrect because states can regulate who bears the burden to prove insanity, and even deny the use of the insanity defense altogether. Likewise, answers C and D are incorrect. There is simply no constitutional right to raise an insanity defense, and both of the proposals would be constitutional."

The defendant then took the gun, pointed it at the victim, spun the barrel, and pulled the trigger once. The gun fired, and the victim fell over dead. A statute in the jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as an intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the commission of a common-law felony, and murder in the second degree as all other murder at common law.

One day, the police received reliable information that a large brown suitcase with leather straps containing a supply of cocaine had been delivered to the suspect's home and that it would be moved to a distribution point the next morning. The police obtained a valid search warrant to search for and seize the brown suitcase and the cocaine and went to the suspect's house.

Answer A is incorrect because police officers are allowed to use force to open a door pursuant to a proper search warrant and because the statement itself was voluntarily made. Answer B is incorrect because a failure to read the Miranda warnings will lead to the suppression of statements only if those statements were obtained as a result of a custodial interrogation. In this case, the suspect, while he may have been in custody, was not subject to interrogation. Answer D is a misstatement of the law regarding the admissibility of a defendant's confession. The fact that the police's presence was authorized does not, in itself, have a bearing on whether the defendant's statements were made voluntarily.

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " At common law, intoxication can be the basis for a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. In this case, the employee is charged with assault and attempted murder, both of which are specific intent crimes. Assault is an attempt to commit criminal battery, which requires that the employee intended to commit a criminal battery against his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. Attempted murder requires proof that the employee had the intent to kill his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. Both assault and attempted murder require that the employee have the intent to commit a further offense. If the employee was unable to form the intent to commit a battery or the intent to commit a murder due to his intoxication, he would have a valid defense to the charge. The evidence of the employee's intoxication should be admitted without limitation. Answer B can also be correct because the assault was actually brought to fruition by the commission of the battery. By stabbing his boss, the employee did not merely commit an assault; he committed criminal battery. The charge of assault would thus merge into the battery offense, and the evidence of the intoxication should be admitted only to the attempted murder charge."

    "explanation": " At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Murder is not a specific intent crime. However, malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that show gross recklessness toward human life. In this case, the woman, by arming herself with an automatic weapon and firing 15 rounds in a populated bank after the man ordered them to lie down, was acting with malice aforethought, and can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought.

Burglary is the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. Felony murder is the killing of a human being in the course of a violent felony. In this case, the defendant is guilty of burglary, robbery, and murder. The defendant forced, at weapon point, the couple to allow him to enter their dwelling, which is sufficient for breaking and entering. When this breaking and entering occurred, the defendant had the intent to commit a theft of their property, and he is guilty of burglary. In addition, the defendant used force by tying and binding the couple, and the threat of force by threatening them, to take the necklace from the couple, and he had the intent to permanently deprive them of the necklace. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of robbery. Finally, the husband died as a result of the commission of those two violent felonies, so the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

The sheriff's department received an anonymous tip that a rival marijuana farmer had buried the marijuana farmer in a hillside about 200 yards from the rival's farmhouse. The sheriff's deputies went to the rival's farm. They cut the barbed wire that surrounded the hillside and entered, looking for the grave. They also searched the adjacent fields on the rival's farm that were within the area enclosed by the barbed wire and discovered clothing that belonged to the marijuana farmer hanging on a scarecrow. The rival observed their discovery and began shooting. The deputies returned fire. The rival dashed to his pickup truck to escape. Unable to start the truck, he fled across a field toward the barn. A deputy tackled him just as he entered the barn. As the rival attempted to get up, the deputy pinned his arms behind his back. Another deputy threatened, \"Tell us what you did with the marijuana farmer or we will shut you down and see your family on relief.\" The rival responded that he had killed the marijuana farmer in a fight but did not report the incident because he did not want authorities to enter his land and discover his marijuana crop. Instead, he buried him behind the barn. The rival was thereafter charged with murder.",

    "explanation": " Because the rival was subject to a custodial interrogation without voluntarily waiving his rights under Miranda, his statements to the deputy about the murder should be suppressed. The rival, because he was tackled and had his arms pinned beneath his back, was in custody for the purposes of Miranda. In addition, the rival was subject to interrogation. Although the deputy's wording was not exactly a question, it was a statement that was meant to elicit a response from the rival, and it will be considered an \"interrogation\" for constitutional purposes. Because it was a custodial interrogation, the rival must have been informed of his Miranda rights, and have voluntarily waived them, before those statements could properly be used against him."

On July 1, 1987, with regard to this incident, the defendant pleaded guilty to reckless driving (a misdemeanor) and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. She served the sentence and paid the fine. On April 1, 1988, the pedestrian died as a result of the injuries she suffered in the accident. On March 1, 1991, a grand jury indicted the defendant on a charge of manslaughter of the pedestrian. On May 15, 1991, trial had not begun and the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of double jeopardy in that her conviction of reckless driving arose out of the same incident, and on the ground that the three-year statute of limitations for manslaughter had run.",

The death of the pedestrian, which occurred on April 1, 1988, was the final element of the offense of manslaughter to occur, and the state had 3 years from that date to charge the offense.

The woman's first entry of the computer and copying of the file constituted an entirely private search and did not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. The second set of photographs should be suppressed because authorities encouraged and offered to reward the second computer search. As such, the woman was acting as a government agent with regard to that search, which did in fact violate the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted without a warrant. See United States v. Jarrett, 338 F.3d 339, 344-48 (4th Cir. 2003) (describing relevant considerations, and finding on facts less compelling than these that private hacker was not government agent).

Deliberation is defined as \"cool reflection for any length of time, no matter how brief.\" The defendant, despondent and angry over losing his job, was contemplating suicide. He took his revolver, went to a bar, and drank until he was very intoxicated. A customer on the next stool was telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize and become more efficient in order to keep the economy strong. The defendant turned to him and said, \"Why don't you shut the hell up.\" The customer responded, \"This is a free country and I can say what I want,\" all the while shaking his finger at the defendant. The finger-shaking, combined with his already bad disposition and the alcohol, enraged the defendant.

Whether the defendant is guilty of murder, or guilty only of manslaughter, depends upon whether he fired the third shot in the heat of passion provoked by the neighbor's earlier attack. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought, whereas manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but-for the existence of an adequate provocation for the killing.

    "question": "  After a liquor store was robbed, the police received an anonymous telephone call naming a store employee as the perpetrator of the robbery. Honestly believing that their actions were permitted by the U.S. Constitution, the police talked one of the employee's neighbors into going to the employee's home with a hidden tape recorder to engage him in a conversation about the crime. During the conversation, the employee admitted committing the robbery. The employee was charged in state court with the robbery. He moved to suppress the recording on the grounds that the method of obtaining it violated his constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions. Assume that a clear precedent from the state supreme court holds that the conduct of the police in making the recording violated the employee's rights under the state constitution, and that the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for this violation.",

At his trial, the evidence established the following: A man and his wife were enjoying a drink at a tavern when the defendant entered and stood near the door. The wife whispered to her husband that the defendant was the man who had insulted her on the street the day before. The husband approached the defendant and said, \"Get out of here, or I'll break your nose.\" The defendant said, \"Don't come any closer, or I'll hurt you.\" When the husband raised his fists menacingly, the defendant pulled a can of pepper spray from his pocket, aimed it at the husband's face, and sprayed.

The non-aggressor may use deadly force in self-defense even if the use of deadly force could be avoided by retreating. However, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the \"retreat\" rule. In such a jurisdiction, a non-aggressor may use deadly force only after making a proper retreat. No retreat is necessary if it cannot be made in complete safety. Additionally, there is no obligation to retreat unless the defender intends to use deadly force. Here, the accused used pepper spray on the victim--a nondeadly force--and therefore there was no need to retreat."

    "question": "  A defendant was lawfully arrested without a warrant for bank robbery. He was not given Miranda warnings, but was immediately taken to a police station where he and five other men were placed in a lineup to be viewed by the bank teller. Each man was required to say the words spoken by the bank robber: \"Give me all your money. I've got a gun.\" After all the men in the lineup spoke those words, the teller identified the defendant as the robber. The defendant subsequently moved to suppress the testimony of the teller, claiming the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination. At a suppression hearing, the teller testified that she had not gotten a good look at the robber's face, because the robber had been wearing a hat pulled down over most of his face, but that she was certain the defendant was the robber because she had recognized his voice at the lineup.",

      "optionC": "C. Yes, because the defendant was compelled to speak at the lineup, and this compelled speech led to the witnesss identification testimony.",

Thus, Answer A is correct because the defendant did not provide a testimonial statement at the lineup.Answer B is incorrect. This explanation for why the defendant's suppression motion should be denied is overbroad and therefore incorrect because testimony based on firsthand observation may be suppressed in certain cases if the testimony derived from an unconstitutional identification procedure.

Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy.",
    "options": {
      "optionA": "A. No, because the diplomat's defense does not negate any element of the crime.",
      "optionB": "B. No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat's status.",
      "optionC": "C. Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.",
      "optionD": "D. Yes, because but for the diplomat's conduct, no conspiracy would have occurred."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " Model Penal Code section 5.03(1), by defining conspiracy as requiring agreement by the defendant but not by two or more persons, adopts a unilateral interpretation of conspiracy. The defendant can be convicted of conspiracy regardless of whether the other parties have all been acquitted or were only feigning agreement. In addition, many jurisdictions that require a bilateral conspiracy still allow conviction if one of the co-conspirators agreed to the crime but cannot be convicted based on lack of capacity or some other defense personal to the co-conspirator. Thus, Answer A is correct because the diplomat's defense will not negate the fact that the woman agreed to commit burglary. Answer C is incorrect because, as stated above, under the Model Penal Code's unilateral approach to conspiracy, a defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy even if the other conspirators are all acquitted or assert valid personal defenses."

The man went to the friend's barn, opened the door, found a black saddle, and took it back to the woman's house. The friend had in fact not borrowed a saddle from the woman, and when the friend discovered her black saddle missing, she suspected that the woman was the thief. The friend used a screwdriver to break into the woman's house to find the saddle. Upon discovering the saddle on the woman's table, the friend took it back and called the police. The jurisdiction follows the common law, except that burglary covers structures in addition to dwellings and the nighttime element has been eliminated.",

Here, the facts state that this jurisdiction has eliminated the nighttime element and has expanded its definition of burglary to cover structures in addition to dwellings. The felony in this case is larceny. Larceny is the taking and carrying away of tangible personal property of another by trespass with intent to permanently deprive that person of her interest in the property. Furthermore, larceny is a specific intent crime, meaning that the defendant had to engage in the specifically proscribed conduct in order to be guilty of the crime."

The hit man bought a gun and watched the neighbor's house for an opportunity to shoot him. One evening, unaware of the hit man's presence, the neighbor tripped as he was walking toward his house, falling and hitting his head against the front steps. Believing that the neighbor was unconscious, the hit man ran over to him and shot him twice in the chest. When the woman learned of the neighbor's death, she paid the hit man $10,000. A medical examiner determined that the neighbor was already dead when the hit man shot him. The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness.",

    "explanation": " Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The victim must actually die as a result of the defendant's conduct, or else a murder did not occur. The woman cannot be guilty of murder, because the hitman did not in fact cause the neighbor's death. However, she can be convicted of attempted murder. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. Here, the woman hired a hitman to murder the neighbor, and all of the requisite acts for the commission of a murder occured except that the hitman did not cause the neighbor's death. Thus, the woman is guilty of attempted murder. Accordingly, neither conspiracy nor solicitation is the most serious crime of which she could be convicted.

Nothing unlawful could be seen from the street, so the officers walked into the neighbors' yard and looked through the woman's kitchen window, which had neither drapes nor shades. The officers observed what appeared to be marijuana plants being cultivated under grow lights in the kitchen. Using this information, the officers obtained a search warrant. The execution of that warrant netted numerous marijuana plants. The woman was charged with possession of marijuana. She moved to suppress the marijuana plants recovered when the warrant was executed, claiming that the evidence supporting the warrant was obtained through a search that violated the Fourth Amendment.",

The woman then drove to a sporting goods store, where she explained to the store owner that she needed a small firearm for use in a bank robbery. The store owner responded that he would charge extra because the woman was so unwise as to confide her unlawful plans for using the weapon, and he sold her a handgun at four times the regular price.

The store owner's sale of the gun, combined with his knowledge of the woman's plan to use it in a crime and his financial benefit from that knowledge, should suffice to impose accomplice liability. Selling the gun at a higher price because of the woman's purpose is a high enough stake in the robbery to constitute intent to aid her. For those reasons, Answer B is incorrect.

The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that if the jury found both that the man was guilty of larceny of the car and that the damage to the store was the result of that larceny, then it should also find him guilty of malicious damage of property.

The employee here did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to her boss when the employee dropped laxatives into her boss's coffee; the facts state that the employee only intended to cause her boss discomfort.

He took the crowbar but then found a bolt cutter that the neighbor had left outside the shed. Using the bolt cutter, he cut the padlock on the shed and took the mower, which he then used to mow his girlfriend's lawn. She was surprised and pleased by this gesture. Burglary in the jurisdiction applies to any structure or building, and there is no nighttime element. The girlfriend has been charged as an accomplice to burglary and larceny.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " To be guilty as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must give aid, counsel, or encouragement to the principal with the intent to encourage the crime. Here, the girlfriend is guilty as an accomplice to both burglary and larceny because she provided aid to the man with the intent of helping him not only to break into the shed but also to steal the mower (the object of the breaking); the fact that the man ultimately used an alternative means to accomplish his crimes does not eliminate the girlfriend's accomplice liability.

    "question": "  A defendant was charged with the capital offense of first-degree murder, for which the only available penalties were death or life in prison without parole. During jury selection, the trial court, over the defendant's objection, granted the prosecution's for-cause challenge of five prospective jurors who indicated upon questioning by both parties that they personally were opposed to the death penalty and were unsure if they could ever vote to impose it. The jury convicted the defendant and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death. On appeal, the defendant's only argument was that excusing the prospective jurors violated his federal constitutional right to be tried by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " A trial court properly may excuse a juror for cause from serving in both the guilt and penalty phases of a capital case if a juror's views regarding the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the juror from impartially deciding whether the death penalty is warranted in that particular case. Exclusion of such jurors does not violate the fair cross-section right of the Sixth Amendment. To establish such a violation, the defendant must show the underrepresentation of a distinct and numerically significant group in the venire to show his jury trial right was violated.

The state introduced evidence that a man, identified by witnesses as the defendant, entered a convenience store at 11 p.m. on March 5, threatened the clerk with a gun, and took $75 from the cash register. The defendant did not testify, but his sister did. She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken.  The court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant, they had to find all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.",

    "explanation": " Due process requires the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Because an alibi is not a traditional defense but rather negates an essential element of the crime (the defendant's actual commission thereof), due process precludes imposing upon a defendant the burden of proving an alibi. Thus, Answer C is correct. Answers A and B are incorrect because they treat the alibi like a defense and put the burden of proof on the defendant. Answer D is incorrect because it refers to a resonable doubt arising from the defendant's evidence, rather than a reasonable doubt arising from the prosecution's lack of evidence to support a conviction."

A third state statute provides that a person acts recklessly if the person \"consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the person's conduct.\"  The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens' center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered.",

      "optionC": "C. Yes, because the evidence was clear that the victim was 66 years old, and the statute is designed to protect the elderly.",

    "explanation": " The mens rea or scienter standard for a conviction under the statute is recklessness, defined as disregard of a substantial and unjustified risk. Given the totality of the circumstances--including the crime's location, the victim's age, and the defendant's intent and unjustifiable actions--a jury could properly conclude that the defendant had acted with reckless disregard of the victim's age.

Upon arriving at the house, the police looked through a window and saw a man lying on the living room floor. The police opened the front door, which was not locked, and found that the man had recently been shot in the back and was unconscious. An ambulance was called. While waiting for the ambulance, one officer walked through the house to see if anyone else was present. No one else was found, but the officer did see on the kitchen table clear bags of what he believed to be cocaine. The officer seized the bags, and laboratory tests later confirmed that the contents were cocaine.  After the ambulance arrived a few minutes later and took the man to the hospital, the police went through the house and opened drawers trying to find the gun used in the shooting. No gun was found, but upon opening a drawer in an upstairs bedroom, the police found marijuana and seized it. Later investigation led to charging a young woman, who lived in the house, with unlawful possession of the cocaine and the marijuana.

Once they were inside the home, the police officers could properly seize contraband in plain view but could not conduct an exploratory search for contraband. Accordingly, the police properly seized the cocaine (which was in plain view) but not the marijuana (which was the fruit of an improper, warrantless search). The court should deny the woman's motion to suppress the cocaine because it was lawfully seized under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. However, the court should grant the woman's motion to suppress the marijuana because it was unlawfully seized during an improper, warrantless search of her home.

The man was charged with larceny of the car and with the crime of knowingly damaging the store's property.

However, the testimony of the witness in answer A is the least likely to provide a sufficient basis for admitting the recording.

The defendant believed that the witness was 600 miles away in a small town, engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics, on the day in question. On cross-examination by the defendant, the witness was asked whether she had in fact sold narcotics in the small town on that date. The witness refused to answer on the ground of self-incrimination. The judge, over the prosecutor's objection, ordered that if the witness did not testify, her direct testimony should be stricken.",

By refusing to answer the question, the witness properly invoked her rights under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, and she cannot be forced to answer the question.

Because of the unavailability, the witness' former testimony at the preliminary hearing can be used under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. At the preliminary hearing, the defendant's attorney had the opportunity to develop the testimony through cross-examination, so the witness's testimony is admissible.

The only evidence identifying the defendant as one of the bank robbers is the testimony of the friend.

However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which state law supplies the rule of decision, whether a privilege applies shall be determined in accordance with state law. Since this case arose out of a violation of the federal civil rights law, the court should apply the federal common law in determining the propriety of the physician-client privilege.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " The dog's behavior of drawing attention to the defendant's briefcase was not hearsay and is admissible as evidence of the defendant's guilt. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. A statement is either an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion. Because the dog is not a person, its reactions to the defendant's briefcase do not amount to a statement. Answer B is incorrect because the witness's testimony does not rely on hearsay; it is a description of what the dog did and what, in his expert opinion, that meant. Answer C is incorrect because the witness's testimony is not hearsay. Answer D is incorrect because the reactions of dogs, if the dogs are properly trained in the detection of illicit substances, are admissible."

In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element, proof may be made by showing specific instances of that person's conduct.

The statement, which contains hearsay within hearsay, does not meet the requirements of any exception to the hearsay rule and is inadmissible.Answer A is incorrect because the tenant's statement is not being offered to prove the carpet was defective, it is being offered to prove that the tenant noticed it was defective, that he told the manager about it, and that the manager had notice that the carpet was defective. In addition, if the witness's testimony is being used to prove the carpet was defective, it would still be inadmissible as hearsay. The tenant's statement would still be offered for the truth of the matter asserted, which is that the carpet was torn. Answer B is incorrect because the tenant's statement, whether offered to prove that the carpet was defective or to prove notice on the part of the defendant, is still being offered for the truth of the matter asserted and is inadmissible hearsay, not within any exception.

The witness's testimony is being offered as evidence of the defendant's bad character. There is an exception that allows the prosecution to use character evidence, but only if the evidence is being used to rebut character evidence introduced by the defendant.

Evidence of bias is considered important and, generally speaking, it is liberally admitted. Note that the gang member can be impeached even though he is not at trial to testify. Federal Rule of Evidence 806 allows parties to impeach a hearsay declarant in the same ways that would be permitted if the declarant were to testify. This is because a hearsay declarant is essentially a witness in the case."

Thus the bad acts can be offered as proof that the defendant committed the crime charged. In addition, Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(2) provides that evidence of a past conviction \"shall be admitted\" to impeach the credibility of a witness if the crime \"involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.\" In this case, fraud convictions clearly involve dishonesty, and are therefore properly admitted to impeach the defendant.

The intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness. On the other hand, if the witness answers \"yes,\" then the jury might infer that the community in which the defendant has a reputation for complete honesty may be setting the honesty bar pretty low. In either case, the alleged falsification is probative impeachment whether or not it occurred. Note that the courts require that the cross-examiner must have a good faith belief that the event actually occurred before inquiring into the act on cross-examination. In this case, that good faith standard is met by the evidence presented at the sidebar conference that the defendant was disciplined in medical school. The question does not call for a statement that would be used for its truth. Therefore, it is not hearsay. Likewise, the alleged incident is not offered to prove income tax fraud. Rather, the intent of the question is to test the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation on the one hand, and the quality of the community on the other. If the witness hasn't heard about the falsification, he might not be very plugged in to the community and so might be a poor reputation witness.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": " In slander cases, where the defendant makes a statement that the plaintiff has an unsavory character, the plaintiff's character is considered \"in issue\" (i.e., an essential element of the claim or defense under the substantive law) in two respects. First, the plaintiff's actual character will determine whether the defendant was incorrect in his assessment, and thus liable for slander, because truth is a defense. Second, the plaintiff will allege that he is damaged by the statement, which is another way of saying that his true character has been besmirched. If, however, the plaintiff actually has a bad reputation anyway, then damages are limited. Thus, in slander cases like the one in this question, character evidence is relevant both to whether the plaintiff has a certain character trait and to the extent of damages. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405, when character is \"in issue\" it can be proved by evidence of reputation, opinion, or specific acts.

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": " The doctor's letter is not a business record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) because it was not prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. In addition, it cannot be admitted simply because an expert relies upon it. Rule 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. But the rule distinguishes between expert reliance on the hearsay and admitting the hearsay at trial for the jury to consider. Generally speaking, hearsay will not be admissible when offered only because the expert relied upon it. The probative value of the hearsay in illustrating the basis of the expert's opinion must substantially outweigh the risks of prejudice and confusion that will occur when the jury is told about the hearsay. That strict balancing test is not met in this case. There is no other exception that appears even close to being applicable (and none listed in the possible answers), so the letter is inadmissible hearsay. Answer C is incorrect. The letter is hearsay if offered to prove that the plaintiff's condition was as indicated in the letter. As explained above, Federal Rule of Evidence 703 does allow an expert to rely on hearsay in reaching a conclusion, so long as other experts in the field would reasonably rely on such information. Answer D is incorrect. The doctor's letter clearly does not qualify under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) as a business record. It is not a medical record prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted activity. Rather, it is a letter written by the doctor on an ad hoc occasion. Thus, the letter lacks the earmarks of regularity that are critical for admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule."

To be relevant under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the evidence need only have \"any tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Therefore, evidence that has only the slightest probative value can be admitted under this rule.

The evidence is not very strong, because other knives could also have caused the wound. But how much weight to give to the evidence is a decision for the jury. Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires only that evidence have \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Thus to be relevant, evidence need only have some probative value in establishing a fact.

Here the teller knew the signature of the bank customer on whose account the check was drawn. This knowledge made it possible for her to recognize the signature on the check as a forgery. Her testimony that the signature was a forgery is testimony that the signature on the check presented was different from the signature of the owner of the account (a signature she knows).

The letters are admissible only if they are offered for the limited purpose of proving that the manufacturer was put on notice of possible dangers in using the microwave. Such notice supports the claim of negligence, because it suggests that the manufacturer should have investigated and taken action to protect future consumers.

At trial, the government seeks to have its agent testify to a conversation that he overheard between the defendant and a co-conspirator regarding the incoming shipment of a large quantity of cocaine.

Therefore there is no violation of the best evidence rule. The agent is not attempting to prove the contents of the audiotape, only what he overheard. The conversation could, of course, also be proved by introducing the audiotape, and it can be argued that the audiotape is \"better\" evidence than the agent's testimony. Nonetheless, so long as the agent obtained his knowledge of the conversation from his own perception, and not by listening to the audiotape, the best evidence rule is not violated.

Although the neighbor knew of the $1500 price differential this was insufficient to put him on reasonable notice that he should inquire regarding the purchaser's ownership interest in Lot 25. Thus the landowner would be estopped from claiming superior title to the neighbor a bona fide purchaser."

The father erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile said to the woman: \"I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.\" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill. The son having no assets died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that his son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate.

B is incorrect. even if the father's mistake of law is treated as a part of the total state of facts at the time he made the promise he would bear the risk of mistake and enforcement of his promise would not be unconscionable. C is incorrect. the father's promise does not fall within one of the categories of contracts required to be in writing. It could be performed in one year and it is not a suretyship agreement; the father thought he was liable not his son. D is incorrect. a promise is sufficiently definite if it provides a basis for determining breach and for giving a remedy. Although the father's promise to pay for \"any losses\" is vague when read in conjunction with the limiting language \"as a result of the accident\" judicial construction for breach remains possible."

Therefore the physician's promise is enforceable despite the fact that the father furnished the consideration for the physician's promise to treat the woman (therefore statement I is incorrect). Although the woman was not a party to the father-physician contract she may enforce the contract as a third-party beneficiary if recognition of such a right in her is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties.

This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6 the computer programming company demanded $10000 saying the job was one-half done. The parties orally agreed that the store should deposit $20000 in escrow pending completion to the satisfaction of the store’s computer systems manager.

An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the writing. The department store seeks to introduce in litigation extrinsic evidence of a prior oral agreement by the computer programming company to coordinate its computer program with the department store’s methods of accounting. Since the written memo between the parties is silent with respect to this issue the evidence should be admissible so long as the writing is found to be partially and not completely integrated. The fact that the writing is only two sentences long and does not contain a merger clause suggests that the memo was only partially integrated and therefore the department store should be successful in introducing the evidence."

The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently the store by a written memorandum to a private detective proposed to pay the detective $200 \"for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire.\" Thereafter in August 2007 the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations.

The detective immediately made the claim. In December 2007 as a result of the detective’s investigation the store’s employee was convicted of burning the store.

A prohibition against the assignment of a contract takes away the assignor's right to assign not the assignor's power to assign. If an assignment is made in breach of an express contractual provision the obligor (the business enterprise) has a right to damages for the breach but this right does not render the assignment ineffective unless the assignee (the finance company) knew of the prohibition. For this reason A is incorrect. Note: a prohibition against assignment is not the same as an invalidation of an assignment. In the latter situation if a contractual provision renders an assignment void the assignor has neither the right nor the power to assign the contract. B is incorrect. the covenant does allow the business enterprise to sue for damages for breach of the covenant.

On May 3 2007 the builder notified the landowner in writing of the builder's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1 . On May 12 the landowner notified the builder that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29 and that he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title and he tendered performance on May 29. The builder refused. The landowner brought an action to recover damages for breach of contract.",

      "optionD": "D. There is a novation."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": " Unless the contract provides otherwise a contractual duty may be delegated to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party will have such an interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving aesthetic taste and judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting) the item to be painted is a standard barn and therefore the contract is not one involving aesthetic taste or judgment and the farmer should be indifferent about whether the work is done by the the painter or by the contractor. Therefore the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach even if it was done without the consent of the farmer and if the farmer refuses performance by the contractor he will be in breach of contract. A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect. the mere delegation of a duty even if assented to by the obligee (the farmer) does not effect a novation; a novation would require an express agreement by the farmer to substitute the contractor for the painter."

Therefore where the duty to paint the farmer's barn has been delegated and the delegatee (the contractor) breaches the duty by failing to meet contract specifications the farmer may enforce the contract against the original obligor (the painter). B and D are incorrect. although the farmer may also enforce the obligation against the contractor (since the farmer is the intended beneficiary of the agreement that delegated the duty) delegation does not discharge the painter of his obligation to the farmer. C is incorrect. the farmer has a right to enforce the obligation against either party."

    "explanation": " A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party will be found to be an intended beneficiary where recognition of standing to enforce the promise is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties and where the beneficiary is either a creditor beneficiary (where performance of the promise will satisfy a debt of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary) or a donee beneficiary (where the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the performance). If anything the doctor is merely an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the colleague and the victim since the colleague's promise to represent the victim in his action against the driver neither satisfies the victim's debt to the doctor nor does it relate to any intent on the victim's part to confer a benefit on the doctor. D is incorrect. any reliance by the doctor on the colleague's promise would not be reasonable as he cannot show that he is an intended beneficiary of that promise."

    "question": "  On March 1 a landowner and builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse across a neighbor's lot to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15 and to complete all the work before June 1 . The total price of $10000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2500 on March 15; $2500 when the boathouse was completed; $5000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel. Assume that the landowner tendered the $2500 on March 15 and that the builder refused to accept it or to perform. In an action by the landowner against the builder for breach of contract which of the following can the builder successfully use as a defense? I. The neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not in writing. II. The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing.",

      "optionC": "C. Both I and II",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": " Under the Statute of Frauds a promise to sell an interest in land must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute to be enforceable. Although the land contract provision of the statute has been broadly construed to include rights of way the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within the land contract provision because the neighbor's promise (\"permitting the digging\") was a gratuitous conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1 this agreement falls outside the one-year provision since it can be performed within a year of its making. Because neither agreement falls within the statute of frauds the fact that the agreements were not in writing is not a valid defense. Therefore A B and C are incorrect."

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not within three months after the aforesaid exchange removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.",

    "explanation": " To answer this question you must first map out the required order of performances. The building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner or no further duty arises on anyone's part. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after) the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. So the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent conditions and the building owner's removal of the shed is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1000. Based on the contract language and order of performances cited in the question answer C is the least accurate statement concerning that order."

    "explanation": " While the responses seem confusingly similar this answer can be reached through the process of elimination. D can be eliminated immediately. Clearly the issue here is the determination of whether the obligation to remove the shed is a condition subsequent or condition precedent not whether it is a condition at all. Black's Law dictionary defines a condition precedent as \"an act or event other than the lapse of time that must exist or occur before a duty to perform something promised arises.\" The building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months cannot be a condition precedent because it turns on the lapse of time. Therefore B can be eliminated. Black's Law defines a condition subsequent as \"a condition that if it occurs will bring something else to an end.\" In form the building owner's obligation to remove the shed within three months of the transfer of property was a condition subsequent to the exchange of the purchaser's farm for the building owner's apartment house. In substance however it was a condition precedent to the purchaser's obligation to pay the additional $1000 six months after the exchange. As a result C is clearly an incomplete response and can be eliminated. Thus A is the appropriate response and B C and D are incorrect."
