The parties orally agreed that the store should deposit $20000 in escrow pending completion to the satisfaction of the store’s computer systems manager. On July 5 the programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer programs not being perfectly coordinated with the store’s billing methods cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store’s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion requested that the escrow agent return the $20000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs. The department store denies liability on the ground that the programming company had orally agreed to coordinate with the department store’s methods of accounting and the programming company seeks to bar introduction of that agreement based on the parol evidence rule.",

  "  An elderly widower lived alone on a small farm which he owned. Except for the farm including the house and its furnishings the widower owned substantially no property. Under proper management the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower operated the farm and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract. In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to do so the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm.",

  "  A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1000 per month and a commission of 5 percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer. In 2006 a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750000 computer.

  "  A victim injured by a driver in an auto accident employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim \"to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries.\" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were \"non-assignable.\" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment reasonably valued at $1000 from a doctor but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise. After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1000 the victim immediately wrote doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney. The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1000 all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent.",

  "  A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and his son's fiancée a house on their wedding day planned for June 10 2002. Pursuant to that promise the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1 2001 and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof: The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders Inc. for a construction price of $18000. The father agreed to make payments of $2000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 2001 upon monthly presentation of certificate by Builders Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001 when he also began building the house. The father made three $2000 payments for the work done in July August and September 2001 without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October but no work was done from November 1 2001 to the end of February 2002 because of bad weather and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1 2002 the contractor demanded payment of $2000 but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.",

  "  On November 1 the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school: The faculty seeking to encourage legal research offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1. A student read this notice on November 2 and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law which he started in October a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying \"I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer.\" This note was inadvertently placed in a student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1 the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore: The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn. The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1 it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1000. The law faculty refused to pay anything."
